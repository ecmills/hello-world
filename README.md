starting out

Hello World,
Programming languages really love this exercise don't they? I guess that no matter the difference backgrounds and knowledge that programmers have we all share the common experience of "Hello World" first projects. It is really endearing. I wonder who started it?

Anyway, I'm relatively new to programming and only know some Java. I really want to learn more though. I think this would be a fun way to record my learning process and look back on my development.
